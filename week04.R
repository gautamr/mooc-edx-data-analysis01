# 1) What fraction represents the proportion of people in the study that were afraid of heights?

# 3) Of those participants that were afraid of heights, what percentage were men? (Round to 1 decimal place with no % sign.)

# 4) What percentage of women were afraid of heights? (Round to 1 decimal place with no % sign.)
round(109 / 198 * 100, digits = 1)

# 5) What percentage of all participants were not afraid of heights? (Round to 1 decimal place with no % sign.)
round(183 / 360 * 100, digits = 1)

# 4) Overall, what percentage of participants had a tattoo? ( Round to 1 decimal place and do not include % sign.)

# 5) What percentage of those participants with Hepatitis C had a tattoo done in a commercial parlor? (Round to 1 decimal and do not include % sign.)

# 6) What percentage of those who had a tattoo done in a commercial parlor have Hepatitis C? (Round to 1 decimal and do not include % sign.)

# Graphing the Contingency Table:

# 1) P (black/white/silver)
round(32/ 148, digits = 3)

# 2) P (married)
round(81/ 148, digits = 3)

# 3) P (unmarried and black/white/silver car)
